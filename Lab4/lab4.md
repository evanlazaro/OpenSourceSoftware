### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

Choosing a license is important to clearly define how your project can be used. Without a license, the copyright belongs to you and others cannot use your code. Additionally a license is needed to enforce how your project can be used, especially related to re-distribution. Also, using certain licenses can allow you to advertise the fact that your project is open source.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

When code or any work is created, it becomes copyrighted by the person who made it. If this work does not have an explicit license allowing others to use it, a person using it could be sued as they are violating the copyright.

### Why the Web beat Gopher

The authors argument that "worse is better" when it comes to open source project seems silly at first, but makes a lot of sense in this context. Having room for improvement allows gives space for developers to work on the project and become invested in it. This was greatly important at this time especially, when most users of the internet were part of the hacker community. The fact that Gopher added a licensing fee for non EDU domains was also a huge turn off for those in the hacker community, and seemed to be the tipping point in their demise.

### Why does Android use Apache 2.0

Android is looking to promote openness in mobile devices, and by having a permissive license they want to allow developers to use the software as they please. Additionally, using and enforcing a more restrictive license like LGPL would create extra work for Android and may restrict device manufacturer designs.
